        <li>
          <em>3Scan</em> is a company I founded.  It's full of great people
            and it is a force in the bio-entropy war.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Coup de Foudre</em> is a big group of artists, scientists, engineers, and
            mathmeticians.  We build large tesla coils and other exotic high-power art.
            We do events at museums, Burning Man, and other venues.

    <h2>Some things I am interested in:</h2>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Plasma Physics</em> specifically computational modeling and numerical
            control approaches to plasma control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Compuational Photography</em> of the 5d lightfield that we all know and love.
            Sometimes this is satellite photography, other times time-lapse.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Medium</em> is a place I occasionally write about the above and
            other topics too numerous to mention.
